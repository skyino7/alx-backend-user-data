# Basic Authentication

## Project Description
This project focuses on implementing basic authentication using Flask, a lightweight web application framework in Python. Basic authentication involves verifying the identity of a user based on a username and password. In this project, users will be required to provide their credentials to access certain routes or resources in a Flask application.

## Usage Instructions
To use the basic authentication feature in your Flask application:
1. Add the necessary authentication logic to your Flask routes.
2. Ensure you have endpoints that require authentication.
3. Configure the user credentials and use them to authenticate user requests.
4. Test the authentication flow by trying to access protected routes with and without valid credentials.
